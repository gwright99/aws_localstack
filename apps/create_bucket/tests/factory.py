    # Inner functions, also known as nested functions, are functions that you define inside other functions. 
    # In Python, this kind of function has direct access to variables and names defined in the enclosing function. 
    # Inner functions have many uses, most notably as closure factories and decorator functions."
    #   ...
    # In this section, youâ€™ll learn about closure factory functions. Closures are dynamically created functions 
    # that are returned by other functions. Their main feature is that they have full access to the variables 
    # and names defined in the local namespace where the closure was created, even though the enclosing function 
    # has returned and finished executing.
