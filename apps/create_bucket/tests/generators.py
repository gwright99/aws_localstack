    # As per Real Python: https://realpython.com/inner-functions-what-are-they-good-for/
    # """
    # Inner functions, also known as nested functions, are functions that you define inside other functions. 
    # In Python, this kind of function has direct access to variables and names defined in the enclosing function. 
    # Inner functions have many uses, most notably as closure factories and decorator functions."
    #   ...
    # In this section, youâ€™ll learn about closure factory functions. Closures are dynamically created functions 
    # that are returned by other functions. Their main feature is that they have full access to the variables 
    # and names defined in the local namespace where the closure was created, even though the enclosing function 
    # has returned and finished executing.

# Read print statements to get control loop. Essentially:
# 1) Value is fed in at first yield in loop.
# 2) All logic is processed then we go back to the top of the loop. The processed value is yielded
#    back to the entity which called the generator. Generator becomes suspended again.
# Think of this like the reverse flow of processing.
